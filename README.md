**Zalith Launcher 2** is a newly designed launcher for **Android devices** tailored for [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/). The project uses [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/tree/v3_openjdk/app_pojavlauncher/src/main/jni) as its core launching engine and features a modern UI built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design 3**.  
We are currently building our official website [zalithlauncher.cn](https://zalithlauncher.cn)
